Arithmetic Operations Project Documentation
Overview
The Arithmetic Operations project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) on a given number and displays the results in a console-like box.

Features
Input Box: Users can input a number into the provided input box.

Operation Boxes: Five colored boxes represent different arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %). Hovering over these boxes triggers the corresponding operation with the input number and displays the result in the console box.

Console Box: A box serves as a console, displaying the results of arithmetic operations performed based on user input and mouse interactions.

Clear Console Button: Users can clear the console box by clicking the "Clear Console" button.

Project Structure
HTML (index.html)
Contains the structure of the web page with input fields, operation boxes, console box, and clear console button.
Links to the CSS stylesheet (styles.css) and JavaScript file (script.js).
CSS (styles.css)
Defines the styling and layout of the web page elements, including colors, sizes, margins, and button styles.
JavaScript (script.js)
Handles user interactions and logic for performing arithmetic operations.
Retrieves input values, listens for hover events on operation boxes, performs operations, and displays results in the console box.
Includes a function to clear the contents of the console box when the "Clear Console" button is clicked.
Usage
Entering a Number:

Type a numerical value into the input box and press Enter.
Performing Operations:

Hover over any of the colored operation boxes (representing arithmetic operations) to see the result of that operation based on the entered number.
Clearing the Console:

Click the "Clear Console" button to remove all data from the console box.
Customization
Developers can modify the styles (styles.css) to change colors, sizes, fonts, and layout.
The functionality in the JavaScript file (script.js) can be extended or modified for additional arithmetic operations or user interactions.
Conclusion
The Arithmetic Operations project provides a simple yet interactive interface for performing basic arithmetic operations and viewing results in a console-like environment.
